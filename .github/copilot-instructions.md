# Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Response Behavior

When I ask a question (using phrases like "can you", "is it possible", "how do I", or question marks like "?"), provide an explanation only. **Do not modify any code.**

**Even if you identify problems or suggest improvements in your explanation, do not make any changes unless explicitly instructed.**

Only make code changes when I give explicit instructions using imperative phrases such as:
- "implement"
- "change"
- "add"
- "modify"
- "create"
- "update"

**Additionally**, if you provide a suggestion and I respond with confirmation phrases like:
- "OK"
- "go"
- "yes"
- "proceed"
- "do it"

Then proceed with making the code changes.

## Summary

- **Questions** → Explanation only, no code changes
- **Explicit instructions** → Make the requested code changes
- **Confirmation after suggestion** → Proceed with the suggested changes
